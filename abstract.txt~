Email correspondence has become the predominant method of communication for businesses.  If not for the inherent privacy concerns, this electronically searchable data could be used to better understand how employees interact. For example, after the Enron dataset was made available, researchers were able to provide great insight into employee behaviors based on the available data despite the many challenges with that dataset.  The work in this paper demonstrates the application of a suite of methods to an appropriately anonymized and cleaned email dataset created from volunteers' email metadata.  This original dataset, from an internal email server, is first used to validate machine learning and feature extraction algorithms and then to generate insight into the interactions within the center.  Based solely on email data, a random forest accurately modeled behavior patterns and classified participants in the study as well as other members of the center who were connected to participants through email.  Furthermore, the data revealed relationships not present in the formal operating structure.  The result is a much fuller understanding of the center's internal structure than can be found in the official organization chart.
